# List Comprehension

-> A concise way to create lists
-> Syntax: [expression for item in iterable]
-> Replaces traditional for loops for list creation

Traditional Way:
numbers = []
for i in range(5):
    numbers.append(i*2)
print(numbers)

List Comprehension:
numbers = [i*2 for i in range(5)]
print(numbers)


# List Comprehension with Conditions (if clause)

Syntax: [expression for item in iterable if condition]
-> The "if" clause filters which items to include

Example 1: Even numbers
num = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
even_num = [n for n in num if n % 2 == 0]
print(even_num)

Example 2: Squares of odd numbers
odd_squares = [n**2 for n in range(10) if n % 2 != 0]
print(odd_squares)

Example 3: Filter strings by length
words = ["apple","hi","banana","go","cherry","a"]
long_words = [word for word in words if len(word) > 3]
print(long_words)

Example 4: Get positive numbers only
mixed_num = [-5,-4,-3,0,8,4]
positive = [i for i in mixed_num if i > 0]
print(positive)

Example 5: With if-else
Syntax: [expr_if_true if condition else expr_if_false for item in iterable]
n = [5,-3,8,-1,2,-7]
processed = [num if num > 0 else 0 for num in n]
print(processed)

Example 6: Label numbers as even or odd
n = [1,2,3,4,5]
labels = ["even" if num % 2 == 0 else "odd" for num in n]
print(labels)


# Nested List Comprehensions

Syntax for flattening:
[items for sublist in list for items in sublist]

Example 1: Flatten a 2D list
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
flattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
print(flattened)

Example 2: Multiplication table
mul_table = [[i*j for j in range(1,11)] for i in range(1,6)]
for row in mul_table:
    print(row)


# List Comprehension with Strings

Example 1: Get first letter of each word
sentence = "python is a powerful programming language"
first_letters = [word[0] for word in sentence.split()]
print(first_letters)

Example 2: Extract digits from a string
mixed_string = "order123 costs $123"
digits = [char for char in mixed_string if char.isdigit()]
print(digits)

Example 3: Filter prices greater than 10
prices = ["$10.50","$25.00","$5.75","$30.25"]
high_prices = [float(price[1:]) for price in prices if float(price[1:]) > 10]
print(high_prices)


# Dictionaries

-> A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs
-> Unordered before Python 3.7, insertion-ordered after Python 3.7+
-> Mutable (can be changed)
-> Keys must be unique and immutable (strings, numbers, tuples)
-> Very fast lookup by key
-> Syntax: {key:value, key2:value2}
-> Represents real-world objects and relationships

Empty dictionary:
empty = {}

Example dictionary:
person = {
    "name": "sai",
    "age": 24,
    "height": 5.8,
    "married": True,
    "hobbies": ["reading","swimming"],
    "address": {
        "city": "Hyderabad",
        "pincode": 500019
    }
}
